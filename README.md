<h2>Dynamically Optimised Temperature Monitoring System using Arduino</h2>

<h3>Coursework Background:</h3>

<p>
  
In smart homes and IoT systems, temperature monitoring is ***essential*** for
energy efficiency.

When we using Arduino to collect data, we collect a fixed number
temperature data within a second, i.e., a fixed sampling rate. But a high
sampling rate wastes power when the temperature is stable.

Dynamic sampling optimizes energy use by adjusting the frequency of
readings.

This system will consist of three modes:

* Active Mode: The system enters this mode when rapid temperature
fluctuations are detected. In this state, the sampling frequency is
high, allowing for quick responses to environmental changes.

* Idle Mode: When temperature fluctuations are minor, the system
reduces its sampling frequency to a moderate level.

* Power Down Mode: If the temperature remains stable over an
extended period in Idle, the system further reduces its sampling
frequency to the lowest level

**My Goal:** *Design an adaptive system that intelligently adjusts sampling
rate and reduces energy consumption without losing accuracy*
