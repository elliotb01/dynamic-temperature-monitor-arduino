<h2>Dynamically Optimised Temperature Monitoring System using Arduino</h2>

<h3>Coursework Background:</h3>

<p>
  
In smart homes and IoT systems, temperature monitoring is ***essential*** for
energy efficiency.

When we using Arduino to collect data, we collect a fixed number
temperature data within a second, i.e., a fixed sampling rate. But a high
sampling rate wastes power when the temperature is stable.

Dynamic sampling optimizes energy use by adjusting the frequency of
readings.

**My Goal:** *Design an adaptive system that intelligently adjusts sampling
rate and reduces energy consumption without losing accuracy*
